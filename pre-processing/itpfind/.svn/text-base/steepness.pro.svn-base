function steepness, var, focuspoint

;given a 2-dimensional variable, this function calculates the 
;   approximate first derivative for the four cardinal directions
;   centered on the focuspoint.  The distance option determines
;   how many pixels away from the focuspoint we should use for
;   derivative calculation
; focuspoint is a 2-element array with x,y coordinates in the 
;		var array subscript space
