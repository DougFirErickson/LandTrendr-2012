;center is the point around which we want to extract a windowsize's worth
;    of data from 'image'.
;Note:  To make this more efficient, we have to assume that the center/windowsize
;    combination will land directly on the edges of pixels (i.e. we're
;    working with integer multiples of pixel size).  Otherwise we'd need
;    to resample just to subset, which would add too much time.

;Note, we'll check to make sure we haven't extended outside the bounds of
;    image.
