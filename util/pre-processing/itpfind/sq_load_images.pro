  ;params is equivalent to "params" in squeeter.function

  ;The function returns a structure  with the subsetted image, a structure of
  ;   info like that laid out in squeeter for this subsetted image, and
  ;   the potential edge-offset that would need to be applied to the
  ;   next call to this routine, and a flag to determine if the
  ;   routine was valid.
