function define_window, image_info,  params

;given a centerpoint from some calling program, define the boundaries of 
;   the window to use.  Currently called by sq_load_images and by 
;   sq_movecenter

;First make sure that the centerpoint, around which we're going to 
;	make a window and extract, is either a center of a pixel if
;	the window_size is odd, or the upperleft edge if the window_size
;	is even
;We know that the image_info.upl should be the upper left corner of the image
;	so we only need to adjust that if window_size is odd, which would
;	be the case if evenodd() is 1.  So we adjust by .5 pixels times evenodd,
;	which is 0 if window size is even and .5,-.5 if window size is odd.
;This ensures that from here on out we're dealing with values that will make
;	zot_img happy when it loads in the image


  oldcenterpoint = image_info.centerpoint
  centerpoint = adj_int_mult(image_info.upl, $
  		image_info.pixelsize,image_info.centerpoint, /map) + $
  		[image_info.pixelsize(*)] * [.5,-.5] * $
  		[(params.window_size[0] mod 2), (params.window_size[1] mod 2)] 
  difference = oldcenterpoint - centerpoint 
  
;Now we define the edge of the window based on the startpoint as the
;	center.  If we're off the edge of the image, we need to move the
;	center point and keep track of the offset so we can pass it back
;	to squeeter.  Squeeter needs to know, since it needs to apply it
;	to the next center point before it calls this routine again

  win_size_map = params.window_size*image_info.pixelsize
  bounds = dblarr(2,2)
  bounds(*,0) = edgit(centerpoint, win_size_map, /map)
  bounds(*,1) = edgit(centerpoint, win_size_map, /lowerright, /map)
  
  ;test edge.  Diffs holds the values that you add to bounds
  ;	to get the original value
    
    ;fixed = fix_edge(bounds, [ [image_info.upl],[image_info.lor] ], $
    ;			/map, /noshrink)
    
    
    fixed = fix_edge(bounds, [ [image_info.upl],[image_info.lor] ], $
    			/map)
    valid = fixed.valid 
    bounds = fixed.coords
         ;offset = fixed.diffs(*,0)	;since we chose /noshrink, the .diffs
    	        			;flag is the same for upl and lor, so 
    		        		;we just use the upl value
    offset = fixed.diffs
     
     
     ;Aug 25th.  commented out centerpoint adjustment.  Now define
     ;window essentially just returns the value that would be needed 
     ;to get within the image bounds
       				
    ;centerpoint = centerpoint - offset	;adjust the 
        				;start point
        				;so it's still
        				;in the center
    ;at this point, difference holds the shoving that we did to 
    ;  move the point to a center of a pixel.  Offset holds the
    ;  the value that the center point was shoved to move it to a center
    ;  of a pixel.  The total offset is the addition of both of those.
    
    ;totaloffset = offset + difference	
    
    
 ;centerpoint is the new centerpoint of the image
 ;corners = the edges of the new window
 ;offset is the offset caused by both the adjustment to pixel integer 
 ;	increments and because of running into any edges
 ;shift is simply the offset caused by adjustment to pixel integer vals
 ;valid is zero if we couldn't fix the edge -- this would only happen if
 ;      the requested image were bigger than the original image.
     

ret = {centerpoint:centerpoint, corners:bounds, offset:offset, $
		shift:difference, valid:valid}
return, ret
