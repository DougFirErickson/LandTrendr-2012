;THIS FILE CONTAINS:
;    sq_match --> the main matching program

;Function sq_match.pro
;
;Give it two images, it returns the map coordinates (x,y) of the
;   ref_img that correspond to point where the inp_img
;   matches.
;
;Additionally, the function returns analysis values in the same structure
;   that contains the subscripts.  Thus the structure returned is
;  str.coords   ->    x,y values as above
;  str.valid    -> 1 if value is valid, 0 if threshold not passed.
;
;b_upleft_coords are the coordinates (in FILE values) of the upperleft EDGE of
;   the base image.  Note that we use the EDGE, not the center
;If ignore value is not set, it will not filter out bad values.  Generally,
;   edges of images are 0 and thus ignore should be set to zero.
;Neighborhood is the range (in pixels) within which we expect to find a
;   match.  If this is not set, 10 pixels in either direction is assumed
;
;Cutoff is the percentage of either image that must be valid pixels for the
;   coordinate matching to continue.  For small areas, .75 is good.  For
;   larger, .5 is sufficient (i.e. when doing the original image)
;Threshold determines whether the algorithm considers that it's found a
;   an image match.  The covariogram is anchored at zero and the maximum
;   value divided by the median.  If this is below the threshold, we
;   throw this point out
