; NAME:
;       IMGFRM
; PURPOSE:
;       Puts a specified border around an image.
; CATEGORY:
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;       imgfrm, img, vals
; INPUTS:
;       vals = array of frame values. in.
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
; OUTPUTS:
;       img = Image to modify.        in, out.
; COMMON BLOCKS:
; NOTES:
;       Notes: values in array vals are applied from
;         outside border of the image inward.  A single
;         scalar values just replace the border values
;         in the image.  Good for zeroing image edge.
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;       R. Sterner. 25 Sep, 1987.
;       R. Sterner, 27 Jan, 1993 --- dropped reference to array.
